 This project aims to be a tool for the visually impaired to gauge obstacles in the vicinity and provide appropriate feedback using Ultrasonic technology and vibration motors/voice aid.

 Additionally, an accelerometer and a Bluetooth module is integrated with the guide stick to enable communication to the user’s mobile phone to provide tracking and emergency alerts.

 The user’s mobile phone, connected to the Bluetooth module on the guide stick which is fit with an accelerometer which detects shakes and angle of stick (i.e.; emergency, which can be over-ridden), thus sending appropriate control signal to the app on the phone. The app then sends an SMS notification to a selected contact with the GPS coordinates of the user, which can then be tracked.
